# Changelog

*Functional* changes to the public interface of Redis OM for Node.js will be listed here, by version. *Non-functional* changes may also be included, if they are particulary noteworthy or might impact developers using Redis OM.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and Redis OM adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.1.7 - 2022-01-07
### Added
- Added .isOpen() to Client

### Changed
- Client no longer errors when opened or closed if already opened or closed.
- Update table of contents in README.


## 0.1.6 - 2022-01-05
### Added
- Added .return.first() and .returnFirst() methods to search. Sometimes you really can eat just one.

### Fixed
- Entity now has a better default JSON serialization output.


## 0.1.5 - 2021-12-23
### Added
- Added ability to pass in initial values when creating an Entity with .createEntity.
- Added .createAndSave method to Repository that does exactly what you think it does.

### Changed
- More fluent interface on .return.all(), return.page(), and return.count() on Search.
- Replace .return with .returnPage in Search class.


## 0.1.4 - 2021-12-17
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file because communicating changes matters.
- Ability to specify and override default stop word behavior when defining a Schema.

### Fixed
- Doing an exact match with a stop word used to generate a cryptic error. RediSearch does not permit searching for stop words within an exact match. This error was captured, and a better error is presented that directs the user to either change their stop words or not use stop words in their query.
