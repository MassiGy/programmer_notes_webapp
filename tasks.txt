The idea of this project is to build a single web page app where users can download my notes (txt files)
toward my self-tought journey on web developement.

Tasks:
1. Create a script that allows us to interact with the server OS file system. (done)
2. Create the general flow that will allows our MVC app to render the txt files. (done)
3. Create contollers that will allow the user to download the notes (on a button click for exemple). (done)
4. Create an admin route (secret route), where I can upload txt files to the server OS file system. (done)
5. Create an implementation that will allow the admin to delete file. (done)
6. Create a search engine with a full text search implementation using redis (caching principle). (redis-om is not well established yet)
7. Create a stripe.js implementation that will allow generous users to send me some credit. (do this after launch)
