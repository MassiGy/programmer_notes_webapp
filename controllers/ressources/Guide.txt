Hey there, I am Massiles Ghernaout, and I am the creator of this web application that is meant to help you guys in your software development learning journey!
This txt file is a little bit special since it is here not to teach you something but to show you how you can better use the other resources alongside this file to learn.

So quick notes:

- These notes are the fruit of my personal understanding towards the topics at hand, and since I am a self-thought it can cause some miss-understanding.
- These notes are here more to teach you the idea behind some concepts rather than taking you to the mastery point.
- I took those notes with a text editor, and sometimes I draw shapes in a janky way and can not be rendered as intended in the browser. If so just download the file and view it with a text editor like gedit (this is the one that I've used).
- There is a way to contact me throughout the information given in the sidebar menu if needed to.
- Finally, we are all software developers, the most important thing is that you enjoy learning. See ya!
