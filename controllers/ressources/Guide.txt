Hey there, I am Massiles Ghernaout, and I am the creator of this web application that is ment to help you guys in your software developement learning journey!
This txt file is a littel bit special since it is here not to teach you something but to show you how you can better use the other ressources along side this file to learn.

So quick notes:
    1. The txt files are written by me while taking courses, so there will be typos and there will be a lot.
    2. These notes are fruit of my personal understanding towards the topics at hand, and since I am a self-thought it can be there some miss-understading stand points.
    3. These notes are here more to teach you the idea behind some concepts rather then taking you to the mastery point.
    4. I took those notes with a text editor, and sometimes I drawed shapes in a janky way and can not be rendred as intended in the browser if so just download the file and view it with a text editor like gedit (this is the one that I've used).
    5. There is a way to contact me through out the information given in the sidebar menu if needed to.
    6. Finnaly, we are all software developers, the most important thing is that you enjoy learning. See yaa!
