printf is one of the most used functions in the C programming language, and the most intressting ones also.

the thing that makes printf so intresting is it prototype, it can take from 1 argument all the way up to 100 if the caller wanted to, or in theory it can goes to infinity (as long as your memory can hundel them).

Note: in every printf call, we have to have the control string which is why the number of arguments can never be less then 1.


So how can be this prototype?

C designers used this thing called ellipses, which allows the compiler to take whatever the number of arguments passed to the printf function call after the control string, and then scan the control string to get the right positioning of the followed arguments


so its prototype looks like this:

	int printf(const char* control_string, ...);

and those ... are the ellipses that we were talking about.

Notice that printf returns an int, this int refers to the number of matched feilds within the control string using the followed arguments, so for a call like this:

	printf("hello\n"); 	// return value will be 0
	printf("%i + %i = %i\n", 4,4,8); // return value will be 3
	
	
So every programming language based on C, like java and javascript, they also uses ellipses.



With this we can understand more, why C based programming languages tend to put the zeroth argument at the lowest address, then the first on top of it and so on. 

Because, imagine if we did that the other way around, imagine that in the second printf call written above, we will reserve space for the ints 4, 4, 8 before the control string. This means that the the printf call, has no way to get to that control string, because at the end of the activation record, we will have the stack pointer pointing to the saved pc of the printf call, and then above it we will have the 3 integers memory space, and then top of that we will have the control string, so the assembly code does not have any indicator to go and find the control string  since it is not on top of the saved pc, so  it can not decided wheter the 3 ints are 3 ints or 20 ints or infinite like the ellipeses allows us to do, so it can not go back and search for the control string, but rather it will exit for you with an error message
